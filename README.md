Can movie budget and revenue be used to predict ratings?


Intro Stats Data Science Movie Dataset Project


Data exploration and visualization steps for the final project of statistics and data science. 

Hypothesis: movie budget and revenue can predict ratings.

We went through lots of different steps visualizing the data and finding different insights about them. 
In the end we figured out that budget is not a good predictor of ratings, while revenue is. 

The final poster file explains our findings more thoroughly.

Things still to change: implement multiple regression for the model instead of linear.
